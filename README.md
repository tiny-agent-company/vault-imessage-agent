# vault-imessage-agent

The smallest iMessage agent that can enroll a user's card in the [Agentcard Vault](https://docs.agentcard.sh/vault/quickstart).

- **[eve](https://github.com/vercel/eve)** (Vercel's agent framework) runs the agent and hosts it on Vercel.
- **[Linq](https://linqapp.com)** gives the agent a phone number and delivers iMessage/SMS in and out.
- **Agentcard** issues the Vault link; the user stores a card once and approves each later purchase with Face ID or Touch ID.

This repo is a blueprint. Clone it, drop in two sets of credentials, deploy. The step-by-step guide lives at [docs.agentcard.sh → Issuing → Guides → Create an iMessage agent and connect the Vault](https://docs.agentcard.sh/issuing/guides/create-an-imessage-agent-and-connect-the-vault).

## What is in here

```
agent/
  agent.ts                    model (Vercel AI Gateway id)
  instructions.md             how the agent talks and when it enrolls a card
  channels/linq.ts            inbound iMessage/SMS via Linq webhooks
  lib/agentcard.ts            client-credentials token + fetch wrapper
  lib/linq.ts                 texts a message from the agent's Linq number
  tools/create_vault_link.ts  POST /api/v2/vault_sessions → texts the link as its own message
  tools/check_vault_session.ts GET /api/v2/vault_sessions/:id → pending | linked | expired
```

## Run it

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # fill in Linq + Agentcard credentials
npm run dev                  # eve terminal UI; chat with the agent locally
npm run deploy               # eve deploy → Vercel
```

The Linq channel needs `LINQ_API_KEY` at build time, so add the Vercel env vars before the first deploy (`npx eve link`, then `vercel env add …`). After the first deploy, create a Linq webhook subscription (`message.received`) pointing at `https://<your-deployment>/eve/v1/linq`, store the returned `whsec_` as `LINQ_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, and deploy once more.

## Environment

| Variable | From |
| --- | --- |
| `LINQ_API_KEY` | Linq dashboard → Developer Tools → Your API Token (sandbox: dashboard.linqapp.com/sandbox) |
| `LINQ_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Returned once when you create the webhook subscription |
| `AGENTCARD_CLIENT_ID` / `AGENTCARD_CLIENT_SECRET` | Shown during Agentcard onboarding; later under the org's Settings → OAuth |

The model runs through the Vercel AI Gateway (`agent/agent.ts`). On Vercel it authenticates with the project's OIDC token; locally, run `npm run dev` and sign in with `/login`.
